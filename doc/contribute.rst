swgit is a project developed entirely in my spare time, so its growth and
success can be directly impacted by contributions from the community.  There
are several ways in which you can contribute:

#.  **Documentation**: The documentation can always use improvements.  Right now
    it is written entirely by me, and as such, it may not be as detailed in some
    areas as it should.  What the documentation could really use is some help
    from its users:

    - Point out any grammar or spelling errors, since some always manage to
      slip through.
    - Point out areas of the documentation that are vague and could use
      elaboration.
    - Write new guides to be included in the "Guides" section of the site.
    - Write translations.  swgit gets visitors from all over the world and it
      would be nice to be able to provide localized documentation for them.

#.  **Bug Reports**: Some people are a bit shy about speaking up and reporting
    bugs.  I want to urge people not to be.  If something doesn't work, report
    it.  It may be a bug, but even if it is just a configuration issue on your
    end, a misconception on how you thought it should work, or some other quirk
    specific to your environment, speak up.  These can signal that some scripts
    may need to validate or account for some aspect of the user's environment,
    or that the documentation may need some work to ensure the user knows what
    to expect.  Any issue that goes unreported, goes unfixed, so please report
    all issues, big and small.

#.  **Feature Requests**: I would
    like to encourage people to voice their opinion on what they think
    should be added or changed in swgit.  Once again, nothing is too small to
    suggest.  Chances are, that if you have something that you would like added
    or changed, there are others out there that would benefit from the same
    addition or modification.

    To see what features I have already thought about, you can view my
    `todo list`_.

#.  **Code Contributions**: In addition to reporting bugs or requesting
    features, you can also take that next step and implement a fix or feature
    yourself.  I just ask that you document your patch accordingly so that I
    know exactly what you are attempting to fix or add.  Also, if you plan to
    add a medium or large feature, please let me know prior to beginning your
    work.  That way I can keep a small list of who is working on what to avoid
    any duplication of effort and link people together that wish to work on the
    same feature.  The list would also afford me the ability to contact you
    should a change to swgit possibly affect what you are working on.

#.  **Monetary Contributions**: I am not currently accepting any donations.
    I work on swgit for the love of it.
